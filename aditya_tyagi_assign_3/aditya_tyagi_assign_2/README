I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an

grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I

Assumptions in the Assignment regarding the input file:

1. If we have two green lights, EX: traffic lights at the East and the traffic light at
the West are green, then we first pass the cars from the east and then from the west.

2. Signal of the traffic lights changes after the intersection of two cars.

3. We don't have any while loop or menu driven code, So TA needs to change the input variables in the input.txt to  test all other conditions. Example: if TA wants to test the condition when traffic light at north and east are green after testing the condition when traffic light at the East is green, then he has to change the field of North from "red" to "green" in the input.txt.

4.There is no yellow light.
